# Hotel Rooms Database Management System

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a database for managing hotel room bookings to track the hotel capacity at Hotel Aikilam. It involves creating SQL and RA queries, scripts for creating and populating the database, and designing both conceptual and relational UML diagrams. The system ensures accurate tracking of room availability and bookings through direct sales and various travel agencies.

## Features
- Management of hotel room bookings and travel agency partnerships.
- Daily sales reporting features including total sales, number of reservations, and guest details.
- Tracking different room types and their specific attributes like location and room class.
- Storing guest information including contact details and billing information.
- SQL and RA queries for various operational and analytical needs.
- Scripts for creating and populating the database.

## Technologies
- SQL: For database queries and management.
- Relational Algebra: For theoretical query designs.
- UML Diagrams: For visual representation of the database schema.

## Files
- `create.sql`: SQL script for creating the database schema.
- `insert.sql`: SQL script for populating the database with initial data.
- `conceptual_schema.png`: Image file of the conceptual schema.
- `relational_schema.png`: Image file of the relational schema.

## Database Setup
1. **Create Database Schema**
   Run the SQL script to set up the database schema:
   ```sql
   -- Run this script in your SQL client
   source path_to_your_create.sql_file
   ```

2. **Populate Database**
   Fill the database with initial data to start:
   ```sql
   -- Run this script in your SQL client
   source path_to_your_insert.sql_file
   ```

## Usage
- The database can be queried using standard SQL queries.
- Modifications and retrieval of data can be performed as per the needs.

## SQL and RA Queries
Several SQL and RA queries are included to handle operations such as retrieving agency names, managing reservations, and tracking guest information. For instance, one of the queries retrieves the names of all agencies that have sold any rooms.

## Conclusion
This project enhances understanding of how databases are used in real-world applications, focusing on data integrity and query efficiency. It provides practical experience in database design and manipulation, addressing real-time problems like room bookings and guest management in a hotel environment.
